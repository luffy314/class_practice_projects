OOP: Abstraction
Abstract Class
Interface

Abstraction

	concept that allows us to hide the implementation of a method, meaning we can create ideas/actions without worrying about how those idea or action are done

	create methods that have no implementation

		-> This allows us to establish common methods that would shared with multiple classes/object but not having to worry about what the methods does

	abstraction in java

		1) abstract class
		2) interface

Abstract class

	class that has the abstract keyword

	ex: public abstract class Example {}

	- abstract classes can make abstract methods

	- abstract classes cannot be instantiated (cannot create object of the class)

		cannot do: Example obj = new Example();

Abstract method:

	a method without a code body ( no implementation )

	-> these methods must be overridden (implemented) in the sub classes that inherit them

	ex: public abstract int getNumber();

concrete class:

	first non-abstract(normal) class which must override all abstract methods from any super classes or interfaces

	-> reasons: normal classes cannot have abstract methods, so if any abstract method is inherited it must be implemented

Interface

	another way to make abstract methods

	they will be declare with keyword interface, instead of keyword class

	public interface Go {

	}

	-> Note: the interfaces are made in .java files, so the interface name will match the .java file name

	method created in an interface are public abstract by default

	variables created in an interface are public static final by default

	-> no instance members in an interface

	Interface are not the class, there is no constructor, no blocks

	How to use an interface

		when you go from an interface to a class, use keyword implements

In java we cannot have more than one direct parent

The interfaces are not a class, so they do not follow the same rules, and so we are able to implement multiple interfaces to one class
