    return type method

        a method: it has some code statement meant to be executed many times. It has some action

        return type: some value will be given from the method

        general syntax:

            public static RETURN_TYPE methodName(){

            }

        creating a method with a return type, which means it is not void, there must be a return value given matching the datatype of the RETURN_TYPE

            --> the value is returned from a method using keyword: return

        when the return keyword is executed a value is passed from the method to where the method was called, and the method stops execution

How to call a method that is outside of the package?

    1) import the class where the method is created

            import packageName.className;

                import: keyword

                packageName: package where the file being used was created

                className: class where the method you want to use is created

    2) use the method by the class name

            className.method()

        Note: if you are in the same package you don't need to import

        Note: if you are in the same class you don't need to put the class name part

How to import the whole package:

    import packageName.*;

    * is wildcard. It will import all classes in the defined package
