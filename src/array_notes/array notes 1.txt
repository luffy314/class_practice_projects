Array: a data structure, which is a collection of data in one object

	Before we had normal variables that stored one piece of information at a time

	In programming working with multiple data is very common

	Arrays are objects

How to create arrays

	there is two ways to make an array

	1) datatype [] arrayName = { element, element, element };

		able to make an array with initial elements. These elements are given between the curly brackets. Each element is separated by a comma

		Ex:

			String [] cities = { "Chicago", "New York" , "Houston", "Denver", "Pittsburgh" };

			int [] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4};

	2) datatype [] arrayName = new datatype[size];

		able to make an array of a certain size. These elements have a default value. There is elements created for each position made in the array

		Ex: String [] cities = new String[5]; [ null, null, null, null, null ]

			int [] nums = new int[4]; [0, 0, 0, 0]

			boolean [] bool = new boolean[2]; [false, false]

		Default values for array types

			String --> null
			int --> 0
			double --> 0.0
			boolean --> false

		Q: What is the difference between null and "" (empty space)

			null means nothing, for objects
			empty space is a String, but it has no characters

			Scanner input = null; // no actually Scanner object

	Note:

		int [] name
			vs
		int name []

		both make an array, but the brackets in the middle are preferred

How to read/use elements from an array

	using the name of the array and the index number you are able to use that element

	arrayName[index] --> gives back the element

How do you know the number of elements

	using the length value

	arrayName.length --> gives back how many elements there is

	Q: What is the difference between length() and length

		length() is a String method to return the number of characters

		length is an array property that returns the number of elements

	Q: How can you access the last element

		last index --> length - 1

		arrayName[ arrayName.length - 1 ]

How to print all the elements in the array

	by default print an array:
		System.out.println(arrayName)

		will show the hash location of the object in the memory

	We must use the Arrays class

		Arrays class is a utility class, which has some useful methods

			in order to use a class we need to import it:
				import java.util.Arrays;

		Arrays.toString() --> returns a String format of the whole array

		System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arrayName));

How to assign/reassign elements in an array

	arrayName[index] = value;

Looping through an array

	in for loop:

		arrayName[i]

			where i is a variable declared in the loop that iterates 1 index at a time
