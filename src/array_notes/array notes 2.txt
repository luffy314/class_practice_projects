Day 29 Arrays

____________________________________________________________

Array
for each loop
__________________________________________________________

Array: a data structure that holds multiple pieces of information

	2 ways to make arrays

		datatype [] name = { elements, elements, elements};

		int [] a = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

	or

		datatype [] name = new datatype[size];

		int [] b = new int[5];

		--> When you create an array this way, an empty array is made with default values based on your datatype

			String --> null
			int --> 0
			double --> 0.0
			boolean --> false
			char --> '\u0000' // don't worry about it so much

Read elements from an array

	name[index]  --> gives back the element

Assign/reassign elements in an array

	name[index] = value;

Printing the whole array

	the array object cannot be printed directly in the print statement

	we must use Arrays.toString() method which accepts an array as an argument and returns a String format of our array

How to iterate through an array

	name[i]   where i is an int number in some loop that will go up by one

__________________________________________________________

For Each Loop

	used with data structures/collections

	so we know arrays

	syntax:

		for(datatype variableName : array/collection){

		}

		action: the loop will iterate through the array on the right side of the colon.
				it goes from the first element to the last elements always
				each iteration the element value will be used in the loop as the variableName defined

		datatype in the loop declaration is the type of the elements

		ex:

			int [] arr = {10, 20, 30};

			for(int num : arr){
				System.out.println(num);
			}

			iteration 1:
				num would be 10, prints 10

			iteration 2:
				num would be 20, prints 20

			iteration 3:
				num would be 30, prints 30


		traditional loop vs for each loop iteration:

			array[i] is the same as num in the for each loop

	When should you use for each:

		- if you want to iterate through all the elements

		- read the values

	When can you not use for each:

		- use indexes: to change/update a variable dynamically

		- modify the array in any way
