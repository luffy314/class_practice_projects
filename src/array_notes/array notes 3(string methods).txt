String methods:

for each loop

    a loop used to iterate through a collection/data structure

        there is many collections, right now we are using arrays

    it will always iterate through the elements from the beginning to the end

    syntax:

        for(datatype name : array){

        }


        datatype is the type of each element in the array


        name: represent every element during the execution
            in traditional loop the way to get every element is using array[i]


    When to use for each

        - whenever you need to check each element of your array

        - whenever you need to only read values, meaning no values in the array will be changed

    When not to use for each

        - whenever you need to use indexes

        - whenever you would need to change the array

String methods that are related to arrays

    toCharArray()
        no arguments
        returns a char []

        --> converts the String to a char array

            Ex:
                String s = "abc";
                s.toCharArray() --> [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ];

Note: String class works with char [] internally

    - converting a char [] to a String:

        using the new String approach of creating an array and giving the char [] as the argument

        ex:
            char [] arr = {'z', 'y', 'x'};

            String str = new String(arr); // "zyx"

    split():
        String argument
        returns a String []

    --> converts the String into a String [] by separating the String into different parts, which become the elements of the String

    -> the delimiter/separator is not included as an element. This determine how the String will be split it

    most common use case:

        convert a sentence to an array, where every word is an element

        Ex:

            String str = "Today is Monday";
            String [] words = str.split(" ")  --> [Today, is, Monday]

            words[0] --> Today
            words[1] --> is
            words[2] --> Monday

    if you split by empty space
        it returns back a String [] of each character in the String

        Ex:
            String s = "abc";

            s.split("") --> [ "a", "b", "c"];
