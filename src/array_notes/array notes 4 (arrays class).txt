Arrays Class

	https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html

	a class that has methods for arrays

	located in the java.util

		-> so to use this class you must import java.util.Arrays;

	Methods:

		Arrays.toString(arr): allowed us to print arrays objects as a String

			--> array is the argument

			Ex:
				String [] s = {"a", "b", "c"};
				Arrays.toString(s) --> [a, b, c]


		Arrays.sort(arr): sort the elements in ascending order (smallest to largest)

			--> array is the argument

			does not return anything

			for String/character types: lexicographical, means order in ascii table

				special characters --> number --> uppercase (A-Z) --> lowercase(a-z)

				aaa, aab aac

			--> this method does not have a return(nothing to store), it will sort the object
				array object are mutable, you can change the object after making
					-> The size is fixed

		Arrays.equals(arr, arr2): checks if the two given arrays are equal - they have the same elements

			--> two array argument
			--> returns boolean

String method:

	String.join()

		two arguments:
			String: which characters you want to separate, or be in between the elements
			array: the data structure where the elements come from

		lets you convert the array object to a String using a different format. You able to define the sequence of characters that will separate the element from the array
