Day 50 Inheritance

java.day50_inheritance
____________________________________________________________

OOP: Inheritance
____________________________________________________________

creating sub-packages:

java.day50_inheritance.book
java.day50_inheritance.computer

	today we used the above two packages to work
	the java.day50_inheritance was the base package and putting a dot with a package after allowed us to create a sub package (package inside of the package)

	so doing java.day50_inheritance.book directly in the src created the base java.day50_inheritance package with the book sub package inside

	then later we did java.day50_inheritance.computer which made another sub package, computer, in todays back package: java.day50_inheritance

constructor with inheritance

	- constructor is not inherited

	- the child class constructor must always call the parent class constructor

	-> using super() we can call the parent constructor

	-> default constructor always called super() in the first line

	the rules of super() are the same as this()

Q: What is the difference between this vs super

	this: reference of the current object

	super: reference of the parent class object

Q: What is the difference between this() vs super()

	this(): used to chain the constructor in the same class

	super(): used to call the parent constructor from a different class

Object class

	the parent of all classes

	located in the java.lang package

	- doesn't need to be defined, it is automatically inherited

	this is were the toString method is coming from

- Take a look at the Book class from today

	we originally had String author
	but this was only a String type so it could only have characters
	We made a separate Author class, so be able to define the information of an Author better
	That allowed us to replace the String author with Author

		-> Author author
			becomes an instance variable, it belongs to the objects of the class, which were Book objects

	summary: Give us more information about the author besides just a name
