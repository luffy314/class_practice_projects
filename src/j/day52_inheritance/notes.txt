Method Overriding

	changing the implementation/code of a method that is defined and inherited in a super class

	why do we need overriding?
		define a more specific method for the sub classes

Q: What is the difference between overloading and overriding

	overloading is to change the number or type of parameters to allow another method with the same name and this happens in the same file

	overriding is changing the implementation of the method between a super and sub class, so the method in the sub classes works differently for the sub class objects

____________________________________________________________

final keyword

	not being able to change

	final variable:  variable that cannot be changed, after it has a value it cannot be reassigned

		Ex: final int a = 5;
			a = 10; // this will give problem

		Q: What are constants?

			static final variables. Information that cannot be changed. Can be access anywhere by class name

			Ex: Math.PI

		Note: Convention for constant variables is to define the name in all uppercase

	final method: method that cannot be overridden, which means you cannot change the implementation

		Q: Can you overload a final method

			yes, you create a method with the same name and different parameters

	final class: this class cannot be the parent of another class

		Q: Can a final class be a child class

			yes, at least it will be the child of the Object class

java.day52_inheritance.final_example

How to access anything in IntelliJ

	hover over + press command/control + click on highlighted item

Can you have multiple classes in a file

	yes, but the public class must match the .java file name

	you should only have 1 public class in a file

java.day52_inheritance.hiding

Q: Can you override static methods?

	No, you cannot override static method, They will become hidden

	You will have access to both methods, the original one in the parent class (hidden) and the new one you make in the child class

	instance method: we can override which means we can change the implementation

	static methods: we cannot override

		if we create a static method with the same name the parent class method will become hidden

Q: Can you override variables

	No, but you can hide them

	If you declare a variable in the child class which was also declare in the parent class, then the parent class variable will be hidden
