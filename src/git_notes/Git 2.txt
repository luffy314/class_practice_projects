Create git ignore

	Option 1) right click on project -> new -> file -> .gitignore
		type the normal files to ignore

	Option 2) you select the file/s you want to add to git ignore -> right click on the files -> git -> add to gitignore

Commit the changes locally

Sharing the project

	Sharing by going to git -> github -> share on github

		- creates a remote repository on github
		- link our project with the remote repository
		- push the changes so far

	or manually:

		- went to github.com -> repositories

		- create a new repository

		- took the link from github, then go to intelliJ, go to git -> manage remotes and add click the plus icon. put the url

		- push the first changes

created a new branch

	right click on master branch -> new branch from master
	we called the branch our names -> checkout to new branch

	made changes on name branch and then commit
	made more changes on name branch and then commit

	push the local name branch to the origin name branch
		(the first time we push a new branch, intelliJ offers to create the origin branch for us)

create a pull request
	What was a pull request: a step between merging branches to allow review of the changes

	1) go to remote repository
		find the pull request menu
		create a new pull request
			master(base) <- name branch (compare)
				compare/merge the changes in the name branch to the master branch

		assign a reviewer and they will comment, discuss, and then approve changes

		after pull request is approved the branches are merged. In this case the origin master has all the changes so far

update my local master

	so far the changes were merged to the origin master and so I needed to checkout to my local master in IntelliJ and update

	or you can pull

	update: gets the changes from the same branch origin/local

	pull: allows you to get the changes from any branch

cloning

	go to the remote repository on github
	click the green code button and copy the given https link
	in intelliJ go to file -> new -> project from version control
	paste the url
