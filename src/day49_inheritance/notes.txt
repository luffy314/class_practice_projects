OOP: Inheritance
____________________________________________________________

Inheritance

	allows a class to inherit(get) information and actions from different classes

		define a general class --> go to a more specific class

	+ provide code re-usability and maintainability

	+ a good way to organize and group common information and actions

Names of class with inheritance

	parent == super == base

	child == sub == derived

How to inherit in java

	we use extends keyword on the class we want to inherit to

How inheritance works

	pass the information and actions from the parent class to the child class

	Ex:

		public class Planet {
			int distanceFromSun;
		}

		public class Earth extends Planet {

		}

	Planet is the super class
	Earth is the sub class

	The Planet class will pass its information to the Earth class

Is A Relations

	Inheritance creates is a relation between classes. It is a way to describe how the classes are related to each other

	generic syntax:
		child is a parent
		sub is a super

	Earth is a Planet

What is inherited?

	- all public variables and methods
	- all protected variables and methods
	- default variables and method when the classes are in the same package

What is not inherited?

	- constructors
	- all private variables and methods
	- default variables and method when the classes are not in the same package
