Custom Classes
Constructor
____________________________________________________________

Constructor

	a special method that is executed when the object is created
	does not have a return type
	run one time
	usually used to initialize the object, set the initial values to the instance variables

	public class Paper{

		public Paper(){

		}

	}

class: Paper

constructor:

	Paper(){

	}

calling the constructor to create an object

	new Paper() --> this creates an object of the Paper class and it does this by calling the constructor from that class

overloading the constructor

	create multiple constructors in a class by making different constructors with different parameters

	-> this means you create different ways to make the objects of the class

this keyword

	it is a reference to the objects/instance of the class

	mainly used to tell the compiler the difference between a instance variable and a local variable

		-> java prioritizes the local variables

	any variables made in a method, loop, if statement etc, is a local variable which belongs to that code block. It is available to use until the close bracket

	instance variable belonging to each object. Make object to use those variables

constructor chaining

	constructor calling another constructor in the same class

	this()

	helps to reduce repetition

	rules:

		- constructor call must be on the first line
		- cannot do more than one constructor call
		- constructor cannot call itself or contain itself
			-> the constructor that is called should not call back to current constructor
		- this() can only be used in a constructor

this vs this()

	this: reference to instance members: instance variable and instance methods

	this(): call another constructor
